	abstract = {This article describes the operation of two new tests of authorship and offers some results. Both tests rely on controlled contrasts of word-frequency and both exclude the very common words, which have been put to such good use in recent years. One test treats of words used with some consistency by a target-author but more sporadically by others. The second treats of words used sporadically by the target-author but not by most others. (The inclusion of words that some other authors use avoids the strict constraint that has impoverished this form of evidence.) In suitable cases, both tests prove very accurate. The fact that evidence of authorship can be detected in these three distinct frequency-strata helps to explain why such tests should work at all and so encourages the development of even better ones.},

	abstract = {This paper concerns an empirical evaluation of nine different measures of distinctiveness or ‘keyness’ in the context of Computational Literary Studies. We use nine different sets of literary texts (specifically, novels) written in seven different languages as a basis for this evaluation. The evaluation is performed as a downstream classification task, where segments of the novels need to be classified by subgenre or period of first publication. The classifier receives different numbers of features identified using different measures of distinctiveness. The main contribution of our paper is that we can show that across a wide variety of parameters, but especially when only a small number of features is used, (more recent) dispersion-based measures very often outperform other (more established) frequency-based measures by significant margins. Our findings support an emerging trend to consider dispersion as an important property of words in addition to frequency.\&nbsp;},

The goal of our project is to achieve a deeper understanding of the different measures of distinctiveness and to propose improvements for their implementation and use. For this purpose, we created a conceptual framework of different measures of distinctiveness.
